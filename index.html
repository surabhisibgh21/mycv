          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a passionate and highly motivated person, with excellent communication skills and a natural ability to collaborate. I am a team player who can smoothly work in fast-paced environments. Every team I am a part of receives my energy and confidence, regardless of what the environment happens to be. Even though I did not engage with mathematics in high school, I have a passion for technology and programming that drives my determination to pursue opportunities in the IT sector. I believe continuous learning and growth are important, and I take my job and career extremely seriously. I have a strong grounding in my current course and safety around my attitude to learn about, and to contribute to, anything that comes up.
